It is also suitable as a secondary benchmark alongside major market indices, particularly for asset owners with significant global assets seeking to integrate carbon considerations into their investment strategies. The index leverages the S&P Carbon Global Standard for company carbon intensity comparisons and filters for best-in-class performers, making it a robust tool for low-carbon investing.",
