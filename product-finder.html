It determines the amount of capital an insurer needs, beyond its reserves, to absorb potential losses from a range of market, credit, and insurance risks under four distinct stress scenarios. By comparing an insurer's total adjusted capital (TAC) against the calculated capital requirements, the model provides a foundational assessment of capital and earnings. This output is a key component, alongside qualitative factors, in determining an insurer's overall credit rating according to the \"Insurer Risk-Based Capital Adequacy -- Methodology And Assumptions\" criteria.",

Standard & Poor’s continually receives inquiries from tax-exempt issuers – including states and local governments, housing agencies, universities, hospitals and other not-for-profit entities, regarding their ability to use their own assets as a substitute for bank liquidity facilities. Given that CP rollovers and failed VRDO remarketings rarely occur, certain highly capitalized issuers can use their own assets to provide liquidity support.",
