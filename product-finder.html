An issuer’s liquid assets can provide it with a cost-effective alternative to bank liquidity facilities – including lines of credit and standby bond purchase agreements – that have traditionally been used to provide liquidity support. Standard & Poor’s continually receives inquiries from tax-exempt issuers – including states and local governments, housing agencies, universities, hospitals and other not-for-profit entities, regarding their ability to use their own assets as a substitute for bank liquidity facilities. Given that CP rollovers and failed VRDO remarketings rarely occur, certain highly capitalized issuers can use their own assets to provide liquidity support."

Credit Quality Fund Ratings address the level of protection that the fund's portfolio holdings provide against losses from credit defaults. Rating categories range from 'AAAf' (highest level of protection against losses from credit defaults) to 'CCCf' (for funds that are extremely vulnerable to losses from credit defaults). Fund Credit Quality Ratings are typically used in combination with Fund Volatility Ratings. \n\nFund Volatility Ratings are based on an analysis of a fund's investment strategy and portfolio level risk- including interest rate, credit, liquidity, concentration, call-and-option and currency risks. Volatility fund ratings are not credit ratings. Volatility Fund Ratings address the fund's sensitivity to changing market conditions and are expressed on a scale from 'S1' (lowest volatility) to 'S6' (highest volatility).
